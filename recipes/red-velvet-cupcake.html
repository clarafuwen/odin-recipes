    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ol><li>2 ½ cups flour
    </li>
    <li>½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
    </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda
    </li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt
    </li>
    <li>2 cups sugar
    </li>
    <li>1 cup butter, softened
    </li>
    <li>4 large eggs
    </li>
    <li>1 cup sour cream
    </li>
    <li>½ cup milk
    </li>
    <li>1 (1 ounce) bottle McCormick Red Food Color
    </li>
    <li>2 teaspoons McCormick Pure Vanilla Extract
    </li></ol>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol><li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 30 muffin cups with paper liners.

    </li>
    <li>Make cake: Mix together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl; set aside.

    </li>
    <li>Beat sugar and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in eggs, one at a time.
    </li>
    <li>Mix in sour cream, milk, food color, and vanilla.

    </li>
    <li>Gradually beat in flour mixture on low speed until just blended; do not over-beat. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full.

    </li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into a cupcake comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in the pans on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Remove cupcakes from the pans; cool completely.

    </li>
    <li>While cupcakes are cooling, make frosting: Beat cream cheese, butter, sour cream, and vanilla extract in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar until smooth.
    </li>
    <li>Spread or pipe frosting onto cooled cupcakes.
